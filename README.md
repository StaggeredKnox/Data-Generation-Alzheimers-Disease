# In Brief

• "coloured_torus" folder is used to generate data for synthetic data experiment.

• "dealing_with_data" folder generates data for cortical thickness data experiment.

• Difference between synthetic experiment code and cortical thickness experiment code,
former code deals with 3 channels of input while, latter code has been modified to 
process only a single channel of input (cortical thickness).

• Python code for Guided-Variational Autoencoder model for data generation.
